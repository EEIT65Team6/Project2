            Donald Trump’s legal limbo appeared to get more precarious on Wednesday.

            The country gets closer every day to a political and judicial precipice that could see a former
            president
            indicted for the first time ever. The ex-commander in chief’s 2024 White House bid would make this
            historic
            twist even more inflammatory and amount to his greatest stress test yet of America’s legal and governing
            institutions and its brittle unity.</p>
        <p>And Trump is not just confronting a single case of potentially criminal vulnerability. New developments
            on
            multiple fronts suggest it’s possible he could be indicted in several separate investigations that are
            all
            apparently moving forward in a long-delayed crescendo of possible accountability.</p>
        <p>A fateful national moment is brewing amid Trump’s wild rhetoric and predictions of his own arrest, a
            political storm whipped up by his allies, and anticipation among those who have long chafed at his flair
            for
            impunity.</p>
        <p>An increasingly circus-like atmosphere in Washington, New York and Florida, where Trump now lives, is
            making
            the drama around the various cases even more tense and confusing – and, to some extent, taking the focus
            away from what may be a moment of dubious history. And a mounting partisan uproar led by House
            Republicans,
            meanwhile, appears designed to blur the facts, distract from the evidence and fuel Trump’s claim he’s
            the
            victim of an endless political vendetta.</p>

        <h3>Trump’s multiple avenues of legal peril</h3>
        <p>Trump, who denies any wrongdoing, is yet to be charged in any of the cases and there’s no certainty he will
            be. But the pattern of recent days appears to show the legal clouds around him darkening.</p>
        <p>— On Wednesday, his problems deepened when an appeals court ruled that Trump’s defense attorney, Evan
            Corcoran, must testify before a grand jury in the case surrounding classified documents that Trump ferreted
            away at his resort at Mar-a-Lago. The ruling, which came with surprising speed and thwarted Trump’s typical
            monthslong delaying tactics, was so significant because the Justice Department had to convince the court
            there was sufficient evidence to show Trump committed a crime in order to puncture the convention of
            attorney-client privilege.</p>
        <p>Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and CNN legal analyst, said the piercing of this
            bedrock legal protection was highly unusual and an ill omen for Trump, since Corcoran’s testimony could be
            used to suggest he committed a crime. This could involve not just the mishandling of classified documents
            but also possible obstruction of justice. “It considerably worsens what was probably Trump’s most federal
            legal peril,” Eisen told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room” on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>This development came with all eyes on New York after expectations soared this week that Trump could soon
            face indictment in a distinct case arising from an alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film star
            Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Intrigue spiked after the grand jury in the matter did not meet on
            Wednesday. But it will sit on Thursday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN’s John Miller.

            There are signs that one witness could be asked to reappear. And sources told CNN that Manhattan District
            Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been under fierce attack from Trump’s GOP allies, was also taking a moment to
            regroup amid the furor. Miller reported that Bragg’s team is working out whether to call back a pivotal
            witness – Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen – to refute testimony this week by Robert Costello, an
            attorney who previously represented several Trump allies and appeared before the grand jury at the request
            of Trump’s legal team.</p>
        <p>Cohen, who made the payment to Daniels, is seen by some analysts as a weak link in any trial since his
            credibility could be undermined by his own conviction for lying to Congress. CNN legal analyst Elliot
            Williams explained that Bragg would have to test the question of Cohen’s trustworthiness now before a grand
            jury or at trial. “It’s very much in their interests, to take a beat, step back and decide,” he said. “This
            kind of thing happens all the time, as prosecutors decide whether and how to bring cases.”</p>
        <p>There have been increasing indications an indictment could be near, especially since Trump predicted over the
            weekend, inaccurately, that he would be arrested this past Tuesday. But the possible charges in this
            yearslong and somewhat obscure case could center on business violations or infringements of campaign finance
            law. All of which raises the question of whether it’s truly in the national interest to cross the Rubicon of
            charging a former president in a case that may be hard to explain to the public, lacks profound
            constitutional implications and may not be a slam dunk at trial.</p>
        <p> In a third Trump legal entanglement, Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, said in
            January that charging decisions were imminent in an investigation into the ex-president’s attempt to
            overturn President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the critical swing state. Willis’ office, which is
            considering bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges, could make decisions this spring, CNN reported on
            Monday. In a Hail Mary move, Trump’s lawyers have tried to get a court to throw out the special grand jury’s
            final report.</p>
        <p>— And on yet another separate legal front, the ex-president and his lieutenants are being investigated by
            Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith over his attempts to steal the 2020 election and over the US
            Capitol insurrection. In another sign of the seriousness of the probe, Smith has subpoenaed former Vice
            President Mike Pence, who helped save US democracy on January 6, 2021, to testify. (Smith is also
            investigating Trump’s handling of classified documents.)</p>
